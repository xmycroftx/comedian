A tool that tells jokes about a browser

## what is a joke?
A joke is a partial truth that a browser is under no obligation to tell the truth about.

By default, we expect jokes to be mostly true, but as time goes on and efforts to improve Privacy of browsers identity becomes harder to ascertain.  In retrospect, the truthiness of these values will trend towards absurdity, and so -- become jokes.

## How are we doing this?
We're using serverless (mostly-stateless) implementations (google cloud function for the prototype) to create simple functions that return the state of a browser.  These are the sorts of things that the "ZTN" crowd has been pushing for, and have implemented in several manners. 

This is not meant to be a full implementation, but rather a simple set of toy examples for you to take and implement within your own solutions.
